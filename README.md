# web_app
Create my first web application, following Free Code Camp, using Flask.

## Background
Per Free Code Camp:
This program will be code that will take care of server side processing. 

The code will receive requests. It will figure out what those requests are dealing with and what they are asking. It will also figure out what response to send to the user.
